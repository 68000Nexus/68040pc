- Expose interrupt generator peripheral from FPGA

POST Routine:

- Do test of SRAM
	- SRAM works -> relocate VBR to SRAM
- Test interrupts
	- Interrupts work, serial port can use them
- Test serial port?

FPGA BASE:0x80000000
	* 0x00.l - Status
	* 0x04.b - Fire interrupt (number written, one cycle)
